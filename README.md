## Installation Manual
1. Install `stow` using package manager
2. Install all programs you have/want to apply dotfiles to (e.g. tmux, zsh...)
3. Pull dotfiles folder into home directory
4. Run `stow tmux zsh <whatever_else>` from withing the dotfiles directory

## Additional Notes
- For `zsh` you have to install `oh-my-zsh`

(will need to write a script for these to automate)
